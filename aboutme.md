** About education **

I am a bantu from Congo, from a small town called Mabafi in the center of Africa. I moved to France for my undergrad and grad studies at [Arts & Metiers](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en) and  [Centralesupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) where I majored in Applied mathematics specially simulation of Partial differentials equations. Currently completing the last year of a  PHD jointly done between Paris and Singapore.

** About research **
In my current research i propose hybrid algorithms that optimally combine machine learning with classical mathematical approach.
Those algorithm are applied to real-life problem for real-time decision making.


** Not about research **

I see beauty everywhere specially in words. My favorite exercice is writing poetry. 
I see beauty in dancing, which i consider being an extended form of poetry.

I see beauty in culture. Which is why I love traveling countries. 
I am curious about people's approach to life.
