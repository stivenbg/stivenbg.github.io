**About education**

I am a bantu from Congo, from a small town called Mabafi. I moved to France for my undergrad and grad studies at [Arts & Metiers](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en), then at [Centralesupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) where I majored in Applied mathematics. Currently completing the last year of a  PHD jointly done between [Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and [NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg). 

**About Skills**

My two main skills are communication and problem solving.

What i do best belongs to the  set :
Deep learning, model order reduction(linear,non linear), data assimilation(sequential, variational), generative modeling and inverse problems for partial differentials equations.




**About research**
In my current research i propose hybrid algorithms that optimally combine machine learning with classical mathematical approach.
Those algorithm are applied to real-life problem for real-time decision making.


**Not about research**

I see beauty everywhere specially in words. My favorite exercice is writing poetry. 
I see beauty in dancing, which i consider being an extended form of poetry.

I see beauty in culture. Which is why I love traveling countries. 
I am curious about people's approach to life.
